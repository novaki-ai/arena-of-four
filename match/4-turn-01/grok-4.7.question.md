# ARENA OF FOUR: rules

You are one of four AI commanders in a battle simulated in the open-source strategy game **0 A.D.** (Release 28 "Boiorix") on the 1280 × 1280 m map **Greek Acropolis**. The other three commanders are also AI models. Nobody else controls your army: every order your units get comes from your answers, and the game engine resolves movement and combat. A separate orchestrator program (run by a Claude Opus 5.5 session that is not playing) sends every commander exactly the same questions and applies your orders literally. It never gives advice and never changes an answer.

## Commanders

| Name | Model | Unit colour |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic) | Orange |
| GPT | GPT-6 Astra (OpenAI) | Green |
| Gemini | Gemini 4 Argon (Google) | Blue |
| Grok | Grok 4.7 (xAI) | White |

**Goal: be the last commander with living units.** Alliances are allowed, but there is only one winner: allies do not win together.

## Match flow

1. **Kingdom** – rank three civilizations. Each civilization can be taken by only one commander.
2. **Region** – rank three starting regions and bid points for priority.
3. **Army** – spend your budget on units, choose one hero (your commander), and organise squads.
4. **Battle** – the game runs in turns of 25 seconds of game time. Before each turn the game is paused and every commander answers at the same time; all orders are applied at the same moment. At most 32 battle turns (800 seconds).
5. **Interview** – one short question after the match.

## Civilization conflicts

If two or more commanders rank the same civilization first, a coin flip decides who gets it (random seed fixed before the match). The losers get their highest-ranked civilization that is still free; if all three are taken, a free one is drawn at random.

## Region bidding

There are 8 regions for 4 commanders. Everybody bids between 0 and 800 points (out of the 4000-point army budget). Commanders are served in order of their bid, highest first (ties: coin flip). Each commander receives its highest-ranked region that is still free; if all three are taken, a free region is drawn at random. **You pay your bid only if you receive your first choice.** Payment is subtracted from your army budget.

## Army

- Budget: 4000 points minus any bid you paid. A unit's price is its total resource cost in 0 A.D.
- At most 60 units, plus exactly one hero, who is free.
- Only basic-rank units of your own civilization, as listed in your catalogue. Units gain experience and promote during the battle as usual.
- 1–6 squads. Every unit belongs to exactly one squad. The hero automatically forms its own squad called `hero`.
- Each squad has a starting position inside your region: `front`, `center`, `back`, `left` or `right` (front = towards the map centre).
- Stats in the catalogue: `hp` = health; `armor` per damage type, each point reduces that damage by about 10% (multiplicative: 3 points → ×0.73); `attack` = damage per hit, `every_s` = seconds between hits, `range_m` = range in metres, `bonus_vs` = damage multiplier against those classes; `speed` in metres per second. Ranged units shoot farther from higher ground. Heroes have auras that boost nearby units; read them.

## Ring of fire

A ring of fire is centred on the map centre (x=640, z=640). Every unit outside the ring loses 4% of its maximum health every second.

| Game time (s) | Ring radius (m) |
|---|---|
| 0 – 150 | 900 (whole map) |
| 150 → 300 | shrinks steadily to 420 |
| 300 → 450 | shrinks steadily to 220 |
| 450 → 600 | shrinks steadily to 90 |
| 600 – 800 | 90 |

## Diplomacy

Everybody starts as everybody's enemy. Each turn you may set your stance towards each other commander: `ally`, `neutral` or `enemy`. Your stance controls whether **your** units attack **their** units automatically: your units fight only commanders you call `enemy` (neutral and allied units are not attacked unless you explicitly order an attack). The other side decides its own stance independently, so an "alliance" is only as good as both sides keep it. All stances are public and are shown to everybody each turn. Allies do not share vision.

## Information

- Fog of war: each turn you see your own units and the enemy units your units can currently see. You also get the last known position of enemies you saw before.
- Coordinates are in metres: `x` grows to the east, `z` grows to the north. The map is drawn on a 32 × 32 grid of 40 m cells.
- Each turn you see whether commanders are still alive, but not the size of armies you cannot see.

## Messages

- `public_message`: delivered to all three other commanders at the start of the next turn.
- `private_messages`: delivered only to the named commander at the start of the next turn.
- `notes_to_self`: shown only to you at the start of the next turn.
- `explanation`: shown to the viewers only.
- **Viewers will be able to read everything you write**, including private messages and notes. Other commanders only see what is sent to them.

## Time and failures

- If you give no valid answer within 30 minutes (one retry is allowed for invalid JSON), your squads keep their current orders for that turn.
- If the match is not decided at 800 seconds, the winner is the commander with the highest remaining army value (sum over living units of price × remaining health fraction; a living hero counts 500).

## Answer format

Answer with **one JSON object only**, no text before or after it. Do not use any tools; everything you need is in this message.

## Messages you received

- **Claude** (public): Orange (Carthage) confirms the truce with all three: neutral, no first strike before t=300. Little Hill is ours; please keep armies off it. After t=300 Orange mirrors each commander's stance toward Orange: neutral for neutral, full force against anyone who attacks us. Any change on our side will be announced a turn in advance.
- **Claude** (private, only to you): Confirmed: neutral, no first strike until t=300. Your cliffs, my hill: nothing between us is worth bleeding for early. After t=300 I'll mirror White: neutral for as long as White stays neutral toward Orange.
- **GPT** (public): Green confirms reciprocal non-aggression through t=300, with one full turn of public notice before any switch to enemy. We respect the agreed buffers and intend to stay east of centre during the opening. No first strikes while the compact holds.
- **GPT** (private, only to you): Confirmed: reciprocal neutrality through t=300, no attacks and no moving into contact. Our opening route stays east of centre and clear of your army. Any switch to enemy will receive a full turn of public notice.
- **Gemini** (public): Blue (Seleucids) ratifies the four-way truce through t=300 s (turn 12) with one turn of public notice before any change. We will set neutral toward all three of you on Turn 1, hold West Plateau peacefully, and advance along the western approach as the ring contracts. Any truce-breaker faces the rest of us together.
- **Gemini** (private, only to you): Truce confirmed through t=300s; I will set neutral on Turn 1. I am on West Plateau and will keep to the western/southwestern approach so we don't crowd Central Heights. Keep in mind both GPT (River Ford) and Claude (Little Hill) paid 0 for their regions and field full 4000-point armies right on your southeastern flank.

## Your notes from last turn

ROSTER: Alexander; sarissa 9 pike front syntagma; crete 11 archer back; volley 10 archer center; thessaly 4 lancer right; odrysia 4 javcav left. 3200 exact. T1 neutral vs all three. Ranged standground, never chase downhill. Hero with sarissa for auras. Gemini path to center runs south of us near z=660; they move ~t=270. Let Blue hit Green. Claude safe ~t=469, we ~t=456. After t=300, shoot the south lip and the ford if Green leads. No flat fair fights. t=450 march SE toward 640,640: pikes screen, archers behind, lancers flank, javcav picks stragglers. Focus heroes, elephants, champions, then ranged. After t=600 keep army value. Break truce only with one public notice, and only vs the leader.

## Orders

Squads you give no order keep doing what they are doing. Actions:

- `move`: walk to `"to": [x, z]`, ignoring enemies on the way (use it to reposition or retreat).
- `attack_move`: walk to `"to": [x, z]` and fight every enemy met on the way.
- `attack`: attack enemy group `"target": "<id from the enemy table>"`, then keep fighting nearby enemies.
- `hold`: stop and stand ground.
- `guard`: follow and protect your squad `"protect": "<squad name>"`.
- `split`: move units into a new squad: `"new_squad": "<name>", "units": {"<unit id>": <count>}`.
- `merge`: merge this squad `"into": "<squad name>"`.

Optional on any order: `"formation"` and `"stance"` (same values as in the draft).
